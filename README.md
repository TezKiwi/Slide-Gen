## Project Overview

SlideGen is a web application that leverages the power of AI to generate professional-looking PowerPoint presentations. Users provide input, and SlideGen uses the OpenAI API to create compelling presentations, streamlining the presentation creation process.

## Technology Stack
SlideGen utilizes a modern and robust technology stack:

Frontend: Next.js, React, TypeScript, ShadCN (Radix UI & Tailwind CSS)
Backend: Next.js API Routes, Prisma ORM
Database: PostgreSQL (hosted on Neon)
Authentication: Kinde
File Uploads: UploadThing
AI Engine: OpenAI API

## Summary

SlideGen is built using a modern web stack. Next.js provides the framework, ShadCN the UI components, and TypeScript the type safety. Prisma connects the application to a Neon-hosted Postgres database. Kinde handles authentication, and UploadThing manages file uploads.  The OpenAI API is the engine for generating the PowerPoint presentations based on user input.
